# Metacrafters: Javascript Assessment

## Assessment Requirments:
1. Create a variable that can hold a number of `NFT's`. What type of variable might this be?
   
2. Create an object inside your `mintNFT` function that will hold the metadata for your `NFTs`. The metadata values will be passed to the function as `parameters`. When the `NFT` is ready, you will store it in the variable you created in step 1.

3. Your `listNFTs()` function will print all your `NFTs` metadata to the console (i.e `console.log("Name: " + someNFT.name)`)

4. For good measure, `getTotalSupply()` should return the number of `NFT's` you have created.   

Create a variable to hold your `NFT's`<br>

```js
// Code here
```

This function will take in some values as `parameters`, create an `NFT` object using the `parameters` passed to it for its metadata, and store it in the variable above.

```js
function mintNFT(){
    // Code here
}
```

Create a `'loop'` that will go through an `'array'` of `NFT's` and print their metadata with `console.log()`

```js
function listNFTs(){
    // code here
}
```

Print the total number of `NFTs` we have minted to the console

```js
function getTotalSupply(){
    // code here
}
```
